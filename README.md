TODO for the future:
- [ ] Add an option to force the covariate distributions of target and source to be the same.
- [ ] Add an option to force the conditional distribution between source and target to be approx the same (e.g. only sample from source and the reweigh the covariates)
- [ ] Make (covariate) shift stronger by estimating propensity scores, scaling them up and then resample again.
- [ ] Create new prediction targets from the data.
- [ ] Add a proper evaluation.
